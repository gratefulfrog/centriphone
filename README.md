Welcome to Centriphone’s open source repository
=======================

Centriphone is a simple camera mount to produce bullet time effect on a budget, using smartphones or action cameras, invented by Swiss freeskier and film maker Nicolas Vuignier. Initial idea and prototype originally appeared in [a video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWZ1azLPeOlFTngufYH6lng) first published on February 5th 2016.

[The making of video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d45oGNv8H98) reveals how the effect was achieved and documents the creative process.

**We want to encourage you to give it a try, further develop the concept and find other ways to use it.**
