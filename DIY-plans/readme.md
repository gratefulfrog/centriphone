The dxf files are designed for a Nexus 4 phone, 4.4mm thick plywood and 0.1mm kerf laser cutter.  

If you are using different stuff, you will have to adapt the files.

To do so use this formula:
- Fin slot width = wood thickens - 2x laser kerf.
- be sure to check that your phone can fit and move the velcro slots and/or adapt the length of the main board.

The pdf files are from the original work by Nico Vuignier. They do not correspond to the dxf files.

This work is forked from the https://github.com/nicovuignier/centriphone project!
